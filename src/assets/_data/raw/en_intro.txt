The worker drones will collect the nearby resources.
The resources collection intensity depends on the
associated priority, like any other automated action.

[press ENTER to continue]

##tutorial.resources_priority
There are four priorities that govern the colony.

The resources priority makes workers more eager
to gather various minerals around the base.

[press ENTER to continue]

##tutorial.growth_priority
The growth priority affects drone production
and building construction rate. It also increases
the number of drones the colony will have.

[press ENTER to continue]

##tutorial.evolution_priority
The evolution priority is needed to make
tier 1 drones combine into something more powerful.

[press ENTER to continue]

##tutorial.security_priority
The security priority changes the worker-to-combat
drone proportion. The higher security priority
means more military units.

[press ENTER to continue]

##tutorial.enable_choices.keyboard
These disks on the right will affect these priorities.
Keep in mind that increasing one priority always means
decreasing the others.

Try activating them. Use a left mouse click
on the disk or press a hotkey: 1-4.

##tutorial.enable_choices.gamepad
These disks on the right will affect these priorities.
Keep in mind that increasing one priority always means
decreasing the others.

Try activating them. Use a right stick click
on the disk or press $gamepad_y/$gamepad_b/$gamepad_a/$gamepad_x.

##tutorial.enemy_scouts
A small squad of enemy scouts entered the sector.
The colony should be able to defend itself.

Any casualties can be replenished, provided that
there are enough resources.

##tutorial.factions
Whether a yellow, red, green, or blue disk is used,
an associated faction gets more influence.
This faction distribution controls the chances of
a newly produced drone belonging to that faction.

Select a disk and see how the distribution changes.

##tutorial.increase_radius
To further improve the colony's unit cap,
the influence radius should be increased.

Select the radius increase disk whether it
appears on the selection.

##tutorial.base_leveling
Increasing the radius and evolving the drones
are the two main ways to create a stronger colony.
To get more drones and territory - increase the radius,
to get better units - increase the evolution priority.

[press ENTER to continue]

##tutorial.final_attack_warning
The final attack will be much more serious.

Try to make the colony stronger or build another
one if there are enough resources.

##tutorial.final_attack
Enemy howitzer spotted!

enemy is defeated.

It will take more than 15 combat drones
to destroy it, so be careful.

##tutorial.final_message
Victory!

Remember this victory recipe: collect resources,
increase the colony's radius and growth,
and combine the right drones via evolution.

##tutorial.context.resource_bar
This bar indicator in the middle of the colony
is its resource pool. It's full if
all three segments are filled.

##tutorial.context.attack_action
The attack action makes most colony combat
drones seek for the targets nearby.

##tutorial.context.decrease_radius
Decreasing the colony's influence radius is
useful after it reached the desired drone count.
Closer ranks serve as a better battle formation.
